# EcommerceWebsite
The project is an e-commerce website called Shoe Mart, inspired by the layout of AllBirds' website. It is fully responsive, allowing seamless browsing across devices. Users can create an account through the signup feature and subsequently log in. Upon login, they are redirected to the homepage, which features product listings, a user profile section, and a shopping cart.
Users can navigate through different product categories such as men's and women's shoes. They can add products to their cart and remove them as needed. Additionally, there is a dedicated section for socks where users can explore and purchase various sock products.
The project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX technologies. Data for product images, prices, and ratings is fetched from a free API called fakeStorage.
